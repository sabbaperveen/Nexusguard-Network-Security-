## 📘 Report Overview

The included PDF — **Nexusguard_Network_Security_Report.pdf** — covers four major protection phases:

### 1. Application Protection
- Symmetric Routing  
- Client VIP, SAT, and Backend IP Configuration  
- Focus on ensuring uptime and performance for web applications

### 2. Origin Protection
- GRE Tunnel and Direct Circuit Methods  
- Routing: *Client → Nexusguard via BGP → Scrubbing → Origin Server*  
- Protects the origin infrastructure from volumetric and protocol-level attacks

### 3. Clean Pipe (for ISP)
- Uses a **Bastion Server**  
- Traffic Path: *Client → ISP → Nexusguard (Scrubbing) → ISP → Client*  
- Ensures clean, attack-free traffic delivery for ISPs and their customers

### 4. DNS Protection
- DNS Hosting and Hierarchical Server Design  
- Involves Master and Secondary DNS Servers  
- Defends against DNS-based attacks and amplification attempts
